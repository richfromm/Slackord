    src and dest related options must follow one of the following mutually exclusive formats:

        --src-file SRC_FILE --dest-channel DEST_CHANNEL

            This is for importing a single file from a Slack export, that corresponds to a single
            day of a single channel. Both the src file and the dest Discord channel are required.

        --src-dir SRC_DIR [--dest-channel DEST_CHANNEL]

            This is for importing all of the days from a single channel in a Slack export, one file
            per day.  The Slack channel name can be inferred from the name of the src dir. The dest
            Discord channel is optional; if not present, it defaults to the same name as the src
            Slack channel.

        --src-dirtree SRC_DIRTREE [--channel-file CHANNEL_FILE]

            This is for importing all of the days from multiple (potentially all) channels in a
            Slack export. One dir per channel, and within each channel dir, one file per day. The
            src dir tree is the top level of the unzip'd Slack export. If the channel file is not
            given, all channels in the Slack export (all subdirs) are imported to Discord, and the
            channel names are the same as in Slack.

            A channel file can be used to limit the channels imported, and/or to change the names
            of channels. Each line in the file corresponds to a single channel to import. If only
            one name is specified, this is the name of the channel in both Slack and Discord. If
            two whitespace-separated names are included, those correspond to the src Slack channel
            name and the dest Discord channel name respectively.

    Slack and Discord channel names should **not** include the leading pound sign (#)

    dest Discord channels must already exist. This script will not create channels, it will only
    post to existing channels.
